You can build a fresh copy of react very simply.

## Prerequisites

* JAVA_HOME path might need to be defined (though it may not be needed on all systems) (google is your friend)

1. Clone this repository to your computer somewhere
2. Execute `build.bat` for Windows or `build.sh` for Linux or MacOSX
3. Wait. This may take some time the first time you build react. After the first build, it should take less than 5 seconds.
4. Once the terminal exits, You can find the react jar in `release/VERSION/React-VERSION.jar`
