  sampler:
    general:
      hitrate: Determines the hit rate of reacts reactions. For example, what percent of the time does react detect something specific.
      timings: Check the hardest hitting timings value.
      tps: Twenty times a second the server 'ticks'. This is where all the action happens on the cpu. If this number is lower than 17 you will start to expirience server lag.
      reactiontime: Counts the ammount of time in miliseconds it takes react to do everything it is scheduled to do. One tick is 50ms, so typically react is under 3ms
      stability: This percent is determined by your TPS, MEM, and more over large periods of time.
      cpuscore: This calculates the single threaded performance of your cpu while under (or not) load.
      history: View this on the lower right quadrant on the map.
      players: Samples how many players are connected to the server.
      plugins: React tracks and communicates with other plugins. They are typically common plugins that lots of servers use.
    memory:
      garbagedirection: When the server uses memory, and is done using it, it marks it as trash. This sample measures the direction of it.
      used: Memory (RAM) is temporary storage for short term data such as player position, chunks, and more. This measures how much memory you are using.
      players: A very rough estimate of how many megabytes a player takes up.
      mahs: This measures the rate the server consumes memory. Note that more than 90% of this memory will be quickly restored for reuse.
      gc: When the server uses memory, and is done using it, it marks it as trash. This sample measures how often it 'cleans' the trash.
    world:
      drops: Counts all drops loaded on all worlds.
      liquidflow: Liquid Flows per Second. This is when liquid expands or drains.
      redstone: Redstone Updates per Second. Every time redstone updates at all.
      entities: Counts all entities loaded on all worlds.
      tnt: The average tnt primes per second.
    chunk:
      gen: The average chunks generated per second.
      memory: Counts all chunks in all loaded worlds and determines the memory consumption.
      loaded: Counts all chunks in all loaded worlds.
      load: The average chunks loaded per second.
  book:
    trialerror:
      title: Trial & Error
      text: Since there are many ways to fix one problem, react will try several different things to fix an issue. If it fixes, react keeps using that method. This means react tailors itself to your server over time.
    configuration:
      title: Configuration
      text: React is highly configurable. You can disable any feature you wish, and configure any timings as you like. React can be taylored to literally any server.
    persistance:
      title: Persistance
      text: If you log off, or the server reboots, your monitor/map mode will be turned back on (unless you turn it off)
    reactions:
      text: Since react is sampling many aspects of the server, we can now determine the source of the lag. This allows us to 'react to it', fixing the problem automatically.
      title: Reactions
    greeting:
      text: React is a plugin that handles server lag in a judge & react way. This plugin does not just remove entities on a timer and call it 'lag remover'. React fixes this problem.
    monitoring:
      text: React is not opaque. You are able to view everything react sees, to start monitoring, use /react monitor, but you may want to use /re help monitoring first to see how it works.
      title: Monitoring
    monitor:
      text: The base command for monitoring is /re mon (/react monitor). This command sends title messages to you with numbers. If you don't know what a sample is, use /re help samplers
      title: How to Monitor
    samples:
      title: Samples
      text: For React to accuratley judge lag, you cannot simply track the Ticks per second. If you dont know what is CAUSING the lag, you can't guarantee a fix. Welcome to react!
    performance:
      text: You can also view a live graph of your server performence. It is rendered on a map. Use /re map
      title: Performence Charting
    tabs:
      title: Changing Tabs
      text: Each element in the monitor actually contains more samples. Hold Shift and scroll your mouse wheel to select the tab you like. Try it!
